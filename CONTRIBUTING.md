### Scope and purpose
The scale and scope of this software is very small. The purpose is to remain as simple as possible while being pleasant to use, and out of the user's way. Keep this in mind regarding any issues you want to open.

### Refactoring
Refactors of large bits of code will probably not be accepted. With software this small, it's just not really necessary and can lead to unexpected issues. If you strongly feel that something should be refactored, try breaking it down into small chunks, or discuss the idea in issues.

### Code style
Try to match the source code. Comment what is happening, in literate programming style. Do not play code golf. Use descriptive variable names.

### Documentation
The README and related .md files are public facing documents. As for source code, this software uses literate programming inspired practices. Every file that contains code contains comments explaining everything that's happening and what it's repsonsible for. To learn the code, read the code.
