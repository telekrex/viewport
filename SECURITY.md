# Security Policy

### This software's behavior
This software does not make use of, or make changes to, any system files. It relies on only its own files, by the principal of portability and being as system-agnostic as it can be. If you think some part of this software is making use of, or changes to, any file or asset that it shouldn't be, please investigate your claims thoroughly before reporting.

### Supported versions
Only the most recent version of the software is supported with security fixes. Issues related to any extended use of this software, such as scripting, automating, or your own customizations, will not be considered.

### Reporting
To report a security vulnerability, please send a direct email to mailbox@telekrex.33mail.com. Do not use the public issue tracker for security vulnerabilities. Though it might be helpful to you to look through public issues first, to assess whether or not your issue is related to existing issues, or perhaps to just learn more about the current state of the software, if that helps your vulnerability report.
